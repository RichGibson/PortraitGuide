PortraitGuide

Processing code. When run you click the mouse to capture the current 
image from the built in camera, and then it overlays your current
image over the original image with partial opacity.

I use this for taking Gigapan portraits of people, in order to help the
people stay in their original position so that the multi-image capture
can be done with some hope of keeping alignment.

Email me for more information on gigapan portraits.
